                <h1>EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY GREEN CARD</h1>
                <p>Did you know that you can petition for your own green card and receive an approval in as fast as two weeks if you can establish extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics? To see if you may qualify, feel free to take our free test! To qualify, you must satisfy three of the criteria listed in 8 C.F.R. ยง 204.5(h)(3), and this is precisely what our test is about. As you can see from the test, the criteria are not easy to satisfy, but proving that you are extraordinary is not as difficult as some people may think. Remember, however, that in order to win your case, you must demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim in your field (see INA ยง 203(b)(1)(A)(i)) and you must intend to continue to work in your field of extraordinary ability in the US. You must prove that your future work will substantially benefit the United States (see INA ยง 203(b) (1)(A)(ii) & (iii)). The good news is that no job offer from a US employer is required to get a green card under this category, which means that you can take your future in your own hands and resolve your immigration situation right away, if you may qualify.

                            In order to qualify as a person of extraordinary ability under the US immigration law, you need to satisfy the specific criteria. Our self-test will help you understand whether you may potentially qualify under the requirements set out in the Immigration and Nationality Act. Please note that even if you "pass" our self-test, this is simply a conversation starter, and not a guarantee of success in your EB-1 filing. The approval of your case ultimately depends on many factors, including the subjective judgment of the USCIS officer who will be considering your case.
