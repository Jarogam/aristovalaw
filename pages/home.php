                                    <p>Just got the notification that my case is approved. My green card is on its way (USCIS simply send it by mail). Unbelievable! It took me 10 years to share this beautiful news with my friends and family members in Russia who are overwhelmed to see me back home.</p>
                                    <p>Tatiana Aristova is very professional and right to the point person. She doesn’t waste her time and her clients’ time. I think everything went nice and smooth regardless all complications on its way such as audit on the labor certification and request for additional evidence. Her paralegal Zana is very helpful and responsible person who was always in touch with me and ready to answer all my questions during the whole period. My case was complicated and I had a lot of doubts and concerns in the very beginning, but Tatiana’s experience and knowledge helped to overcome all obstacles and I became US Permanent Resident for the very short time. (before H1B I was having F1 status)</p>
                                    <p>The words can’t describe my happiness and glory!</p>
                                    <p>I highly recommend Tatiana Aristova for candidates with similar cases (F1- H1B- Green Card) because I went through it successfully.</p>
