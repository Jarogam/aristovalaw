It took me 10 years to share this beautiful news with my friends and family members in Russia who are overwhelmed to see me back home.</p>
                                    <p>Tatiana Aristova is very professional and right to the point person. She doesn’t waste her time and her clients’ time. I think everything went nice and smooth regardless all complications on its way such as audit on the labor certification and request for additional evidence. Her paralegal Zana is very helpful and responsible person who was always in touch with me and ready to answer all my questions during the whole period. My case was complicated and I had a lot of doubts and concerns in the very beginning, but Tatiana’s experience and knowledge helped to overcome all obstacles and I became US Permanent Resident for the very short time. (before H1B I was having F1 status)</p>

Throughout the process, we received competent advice from specialists regarding filing the necessary paperwork, making adjustments, and handling various nuances.

                                    Tatiana Aristova has successfully brought our case to the status of permanent residents of the USA! She is a competent specialist who immediately points out the positive and negative aspects in the client's situation. This lawyer does not promise you wasted mountains of gold, but clearly sets you up to work together in the right direction!

                                    With Tatiana and her team the process of getting employment based green cards for me and my family went very smoothly. I think absence any additional requests/inquiries from USCIS is the best indicator of the quality of her team’s work. This is exactly what I was looking for, and I really appreciate what was done for my case. Thank you!

                                        Thanks to the whole team of Tatiana Aristova. Got a green card. It took 2.5 years from the moment I submitted the application to the moment I received the green card. If you do everything as Tatiana Aristova says, then everything will work out.
