                        <li>Step 1: Initial Assessment and Evidence Gathering
                            <p>
                                The first crucial step in the EB-1 Visa application process is to determine whether you qualify
                                for this prestigious visa category. To do this, our team will work closely with you to gather the
                                necessary evidence that showcases your extraordinary abilities in your respective field.
                            </p> 
                        </li>
                        <li>Step 2: Filing the Immigrant Visa Petition with USCIS
                            <p>If you are located abroad and meet the requirements, we will proceed to file the Immigrant Visa
                                Petition (Form I-140) with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on
                                your behalf. USCIS will then review your petition.
                            </p> 
                        </li>
                        <li>Step 3: USCIS Review and Response
                            <p>Once USCIS receives your petition, they will either approve the case or issue a Request for
                                Evidence (RFE) seeking additional documentation or clarification. Our experienced team will
                                guide you in gathering the required information to respond to the RFE thoroughly.
                            </p> 
                        </li>
                        <li>Step 4: Approval and Forwarding to the National Visa Center (NVC)
                            <p>
                                Upon approval of your petition, it will be forwarded to the National Visa Center (NVC) for
                                further processing. If you have eligible family members, such as a spouse and children under 21
                                years old, they will be included in this process.
                            </p> 
                        </li>
                        <li>Step 5: Consular Interview Abroad
                            <p>
                                As part of the EB-1 Visa process, you and your eligible family members will be scheduled for a
                                consular interview at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad.
                            </p> 
                        </li>
                        <li>Step 6: Visa Issuance and Entry into the U.S.
                            <p>
                                Once your visa is approved, you and your family members may enter the United States as
                                permanent residents. At the port of entry, you will provide the address where your Green Cards
                                should be mailed. Typically, Green Cards arrive by mail within approximately six months.
                            </p> 
                        </li>
                        <li>Special Consideration for Applicants Already in the U.S.:
                            <p>
                                If you are already in the United States, you have the option to file a stand-alone Immigrant Visa
                                Petition (Form I-140) or file it concurrently with an Application for Adjustment of Status (Form
                                I-485) if your visa priority date, as noted in the Visa Bulletin, is current. This process doesn&#39;t
                                affect the results of your I-140 petition but allows you to work and obtain advance parole while
                                your Adjustment of Status application is pending.
                            </p>
